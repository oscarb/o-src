## Relationships



* Pointers
  - Pros
    * Use include on query
    * Simple, easy to use
    * More typesafe than arrays
    * Scales indefinitely
  - Cons
    * Limited to only one-to-many relationships
    * Gettings objects on both sides requires two calls
    * Conceptually might feel counter-intutive (querying on the wrong side)
* Arrays
  - Pros
    * Conceptually makes total sense, easy to use
    * Include on query
    * Works for both one-to-many and many-to-many relationships
    * Good when the _many_ is a predictable size
  - Cons
    * Not typesafe
    * Not going to scale to large relationships
* Parse Relation
  - Pros
    * 
  - Cons
